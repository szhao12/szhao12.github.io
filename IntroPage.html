        <h2> Purpose of this site <h2>

        <p>
        This site is about all the favorite foods I like in the Asian culture. 
        <br>Some of my favorite asian cuisines which are korean, japanese, and vietnese food.
        <br>
        This can also be a guide to what you can try out as well since I often get asked by strangers 
        <br>what I should reccommend for asian food.In addition to I post all Asian food here because it is the theme. <br>
        This does not mean I dislike other types of cuisine.</p>
